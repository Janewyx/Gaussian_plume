# Gaussian_plume
Code for UBC GEOB 402 Air Pollution Meteorology, Gaussian Plume Model assignment.

The objective is to apply Gaussian Plume model in screening mode to Sumas 2 Facility - a coal fired power station that was proposed 10 km south of Abbotsford, B.C. on the USA side of the border.

This assignment performs Gaussian plume model calculations downwind distance between 10 -10000m from the study site for each stability class to produce a set of possible scenarios for pollutant GLCs (ground level concentration).
